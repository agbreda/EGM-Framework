    "# Tutorial 4: Eco-Geomorphological simulation with Bathtub model\n",
    "The Bathtub model/method/approach is a simplistic representation of the water and sediment dynamic over the floodplain. It assumes that water flows over the floodplain without attenuation effects due to surface roughness or any sort of obstruction. Similarly, the sediment concentration is computed by a linear relationship between the maximum depth and the concentration in the source water body. On the other hand, this model is extremely fast, making it a good start for any EGM modelling project.\n",
