    "# Tutorial 3: Calibrating the Sediment Transport Model (STM)\n",
    "The STM is the component of the EGM Framework that provides the distribution of sediment concentration over the floodplain. This model demands all outputs from the Hydrodynamic model: water depths, *h*, velocity *v* and discharge, *Q*. Its physics consider the sediment advection and settling processes (please see STM documentation *SedTrans_model.docx*, *Garcia et al. (2015)* and *Breda et al. (2020) @ HESS journal* for more details).\n",

    "In this tutorial we will see how to run this model using some of the classes/functions found in the **egmlib** library.

    "# STEP 4B: Change surface roughness\n",
    "The original data from `example_domain2` applied a Manning's roughness coefficient of 0.30 all over the floodplain. But, as the *Bathtub* approach assumes no flow attenuation, we can try to mimic this behaviour by reducing the roughness to a much lower value and re-run the models. That is not a big trouble. What we need to do is:\n",
    "1. Manually update the roughness-parameter in all links\n",
    "2. Run the Hydrodynamic model for each stage and replace the new results in the *db* list\n",
    "3. Go back to **STEP 4A** and run the STM again\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle task one we can make use of two function from the **egmlib**: *parameters_update()* or *define_parameters()*. We used this last one in `Tutorial 1` and `example_domain2`. It requires a long list of domain/links properties and a matrix with *Manning's n* on each cell. On the other hand, we can call the first function passing only a new *egm.params*  matrix, which for our very simple domain here is easy to modify.\n",
