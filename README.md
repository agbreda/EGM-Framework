# EGM-Framework
Eco-geomorphological modelling framework


Python library developed for my PhD thesis work "Eco-Geomorphological Modelling of Coastal Wetlands Under Climate Change and Infrastructure Pressures" (provisory name) at University of Newcastle (Australia).


The library include not only eco-geomorphological models, but also functions to manage files and information exchange between multiple models.

The executable of the *Hydrodynamic model* is provided here, but its source-code might not be under public-use license (it was not wrote by myself), thus was not included here.

In the `notebook` folder, one can find Jupyter notebooks with tutorials/examples to use this model framework.
